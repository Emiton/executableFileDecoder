The README should:
– Identify you and your programming partner by name
– Identify your bomb by number
– Acknowledge help and collaboration
– Give your informal explanations of Phases 1 through 6
– Say approximately how many hours you have spent on the assignment

Other files:
-A defuse file that gives the input lines needed to defuse your bomb (for
as many phases as you have successfully defused).
-At your option, a file pictures.pdf containing diagrams that support
your README file
-A file phases.c which gives your notion of C code that is equivalent to
the machine code in Phases 1 through 6
